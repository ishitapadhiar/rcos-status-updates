## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I mostly  worked on documentation and getting the code ready for next semester. My biggest concern was making sure that if I am not working on the project next semester and other people look at my work, they will understand what I was trying to do and will be able to improve it.

## This Week's Plan
RCOS is over tonight, but next week I plan to study for my finals

## Anything Blocking?

Nope.

## Notes

Thanks for the great semester @ Grace and the the rest of the RCOS coordinators.
