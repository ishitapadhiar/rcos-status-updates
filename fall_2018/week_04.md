## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I modeled/planned some of the more involved funtions that we need for the site such as, create a petitions, view a peitions, sign a petition, etc.


## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to implement those functions, as wells as debug and create any relevant test cases that may be neccesarry.


## Anything Blocking?

I had no blockages this week, but will probably have more next week as I implement the funciton.
