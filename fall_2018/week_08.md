## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I worked with the other member of the group working on bakcend- Richard Poluose. We discussed what still needed to be completed and how we would split of the work. After that I completed a couple of those functions and then merged the work that I have done so far this semester into the main branch.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on tieing up loose ends since the semester is coming to an end and there are a couple things that need to be integrated. I will also probably work on some documentation to make it easier for people to see what I have worked on next semester.


## Anything Blocking?

It was a little difficult to properly divide the work between the two of us but I think that we reached a good place at the end of it.
