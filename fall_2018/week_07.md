## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over Thanksgiving Break I worked on a lot of the functions for the website itself including all the functions for the senate response model which need ways to change the boolean values and the the descriptions.


## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to add more functions for the other models such as the petitions model and the Users model, but that involves using the API which I am not completely familiar with yet


## Anything Blocking?

I wasn't sure if what I was working on was in the correct location but after talking to my team mate I think that I did it correctly.

## Notes
