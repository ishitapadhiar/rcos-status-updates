## Last Week's Accomplishments

Since we still haven't divided up the projects, this week I worked on learning the syntax of Django, since I have never used it before.


## This Week's Plan

This week I will start coding on my part of the project, as well as decide what part of the project I want to be working on.


## Anything Blocking?

Same as last week, so far since I haven't done anything crazy so I have had no problems/ blockages.
