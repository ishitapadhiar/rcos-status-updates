## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I implemented most of the functions required in the petitions model and then I also created one extra model for the senate reponses. I also created a pull request.


## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to work on my presentation which is next Friday. 


## Anything Blocking?

I had a couple issues this week, just getting used to the style guides for python and editing some of the comments on the pull request.

## Notes
