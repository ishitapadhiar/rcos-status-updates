## Last Week's Accomplishments

As I planned, this week I worked on continuing reasearch for the project past the cost function that held me up for so long this semester. I planned out exactly how I was going to reimplement things for the summer including future steps.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue wrapping up my work for the semester and I might improve documentation so that I am ready to pick up where I left off as the new semester starts. I hope to include better comments so that it is easier for people to understand what is going on in the code.
