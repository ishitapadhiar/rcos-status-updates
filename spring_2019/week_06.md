## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I decided to completely change how I had previously decided to implement the cost function, by changing it from a probable costs function to a the probability of getting that win in a certain number of turns. I also updated the ReadMe file so it shows how to play the game.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue implementing some of those functions.

## Anything Blocking?

Last week I spilled tea on my laptop so I have had a couple issues with getting actual work done.
