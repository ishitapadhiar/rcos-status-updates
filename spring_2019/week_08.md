## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I finished implementing some of the helper functions that I talked about last week. My main focus, however, was making sure that we were ready to present on Friday, which included our practice presentation in small group on Tuesday. After the dry run on Tuesday we were told that a lot of our slides were wordy so we tried to rework the slides and how we split everything up in order to make a more cohesive presentation. 

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to meet with Justin and Nick to discuss the future steps for the AI and game as the semester winds down. We have to decide what we will be working on over break and where we plan to pick up when the summer semester starts.
