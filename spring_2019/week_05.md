## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I continued with research on how to implement the an accurate function to calculate the probabilty of certain wins with dev cards. I have a possible solution that I might use, although it isn't the most accurate itmay be good enough

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to implement some of those funcitons.

## Anything Blocking?

Figureing out the cost function is really difficult since although there is a mathematically correct way to figure out the probabilities it will be extremely computationaly expensive. So I have been attempting to figure out the best trade of accuracy to a resonable running time
