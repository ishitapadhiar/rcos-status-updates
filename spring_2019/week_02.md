## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I continued my research on how to calculate the costs. My main breakthrough was the idea that I could base the cost of each resource on the probability of rolling that paricular resource in the game. In this case, the costs may end up being different for each player.

## This Week's Plan

This week there are a couple things that are left to be implemented in the actual Catan Board Game, so I will probably help Justin and Nick finish those up. I will also be continuein my research.


## Anything Blocking?

I don't have any significant blocks right now.
