## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I helped groupmate figure out how to implement longest road. It was a little tricky since there are two sets of directions that everything can go it, which adds to a recursive function. Ultimatley although the algorithm won't be super optimized it will run fast since there are not that many verticies.


## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to implement the cost part of the AI, using the probabilities of rolling each resource.

## Anything Blocking?

I don't have any significant blocks right now.
