## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I worked of the preliminary stages of the AI. Up until this point in the semester I have been researching how best to implement to sure wins, especially given that so much of the gave is reliant of random dice rolls. This week I started calculating the number of possible victories in the game (i.e. combinations to get the neccesary number of victory points)


## This Week's Plan

This week I hope to continue working on the victories, progressing to calculate the raw costs of each of the victories (i.e. if you win with Largest army and 4 cities, the price is 37 cards).

## Anything Blocking?

I don't have any significant blocks right now. I was a little stuck on the best way to comprhensively find all victories but I think I have moved past that now
