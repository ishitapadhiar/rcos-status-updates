## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I finally implemented the cost function that I spent the past couple 
weeks planning out. The implementation ended up being simpler than I expected it to
be since the original, more comlicated, but also more accurate solution that I was
planning on implementing was too time intensive. Instead of calculating the average 
number of dev cards I would have to draw to calculate the feasibility of a 
particular solution I instead calculated the probability of drawing each card given 
the cards that you know are in the deck and the ones that could be (if other 
players pick up cards you don't know what they are until that player plays it). The 
simpler implementation is not as accurate since it doesn't really account for how 
long it will take to get a bunch of super rare cards as well as the real function 
will but it does the job.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue implementing some of helper functions for the cost 
function. Mainly, however, I will be working on the presentation that I have the 
coming week (I will be doing a practice presentation during my small group on 
Tuesday and the real one is on Friday)
